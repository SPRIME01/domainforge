A typical workflow using the Lark parsing library in Python involves the following steps:
1. Define the Grammar:
Create a grammar file (e.g., mygrammar.lark) using Lark's EBNF-like syntax to define the structure of your language.
This grammar specifies the rules for how the input text should be parsed into a parse tree.
Code

// Example grammar for a simple calculator
start: expr

expr: term (("+" | "-") term)*
term: factor (("*" | "/") factor)*
factor: NUMBER | "(" expr ")"

%import common.NUMBER
%ignore " "
2. Create a Parser:
Import the Lark library and create a parser object using your grammar file.
Choose the appropriate parsing algorithm (Earley, LALR(1), or CYK) based on your grammar's complexity and performance needs.
Code

from lark import Lark

parser = Lark.open("mygrammar.lark", parser="lalr")
3. Parse Input:
Use the parser to parse your input text. This generates a parse tree representing the structure of the input according to your grammar.
Code

text = "2 + 3 * 4"
tree = parser.parse(text)
4. Process the Parse Tree:
To extract meaningful information from the parse tree, you have several options:
Transformers: Use Lark's transformer classes to traverse the tree and transform it into a more convenient representation, such as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) or a custom data structure.
Visitors: Use Lark's visitor classes to traverse the tree and perform specific actions on each node.
Direct Tree Manipulation: Access the tree nodes directly and process them as needed.
Code

# Example transformer to evaluate arithmetic expressions
from lark import Transformer

class CalculatorTransformer(Transformer):
    def expr(self, children):
        result = children[0]
        for op, term in zip(children[1::2], children[2::2]):
            if op == "+":
                result += term
            elif op == "-":
                result -= term
        return result

    def term(self, children):
        result = children[0]
        for op, factor in zip(children[1::2], children[2::2]):
            if op == "*":
                result *= factor
            elif op == "/":
                result /= factor
        return result

    def factor(self, children):
        if len(children) == 1:
            return float(children[0])
        else:
            return self.expr(children[1])

transformer = CalculatorTransformer()
result = transformer.transform(tree)
print(result)  # Output: 14.0
